here is application for e-commerce

For this assignment you will need to install npm, to install it type in the following -- "npm init -y" -- which will give you a package.json file. After that you can install the dependencies required for your application to run. For this example it calls for dotenv, express, mysql2 & sequelize so to install those I would type the following -- "npm i dotenv", then "npm i express", then "npm i mysql2", & finally "npm i jest".

Once that's finished you can begin running the application which is titled the following --"node server.js".

This application tracks various inventory and search queries.
You can also add/delete inventory at your discretion.
